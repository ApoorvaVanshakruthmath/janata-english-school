            <div class="about-col">
                <p>Recently, our school organized a rangoli competition that was unlike any other. Instead of traditional designs, the students were tasked with creating rangoli that incorporated science diagrams. This unique competition sparked a lot of interest and creativity among the students, and it was a great success.

                    The competition was open to students from all grades, and they were given ample time to prepare their designs. In the weeks leading up to the competition, the students attended workshops where they learned how to create rangoli designs that incorporated various scientific diagrams such as atoms, cells, and circuits. They were also given guidance on color schemes and how to create intricate patterns that would complement their diagrams.<br>
                    
                    On the day of the competition, the school's courtyard was transformed into a vibrant and colorful display of science-themed rangoli. The designs were judged based on their creativity, originality, and accuracy of the scientific diagrams incorporated.
                    
                    The students' enthusiasm and passion for science were evident in their rangoli designs. Some designs featured complex diagrams of the human body or the solar system, while others incorporated chemical reactions or electrical circuits. It was inspiring to see how the students were able to merge science and art so seamlessly.
                    
                    The competition was not only a great learning experience for the students, but it also helped to foster a sense of community within the school. Students from different grades and classes came together to work on their designs, and they were able to showcase their creativity and talents to their peers.<br>
                    
                    Overall, the science-themed rangoli competition was a resounding success. It showcased the students' passion for science and their creativity, and it was a great way to bring the school community together. We hope to see more unique and innovative competitions like this in the future, as they help to make learning fun and engaging for students.</p>
